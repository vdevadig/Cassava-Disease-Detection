# Cassava-Disease-Detection

This is a Cassava Leaf Disease Detection model built by me, Vaishnavi Shankar Devadig and my team mates Gautham Kumar Ramappa Shanmugam and Laxmi Naarayanan.

The model detects five Cassava Leaf conditions:
1) Cassava Mosaic Disease
2) Cassava Germ Mite
3) Cassava Bacterial Blight
4) Cassava Brown Streak Disease
5) Healthy


Motivation:
The world's third-largest source of carbohydrates for human sustenance is cassava, although it is susceptible to viral diseases that could cause food instability. To assist in enhanced control, which will stop this crisis, novel methods of cassava disease detection are required. With rapid technological advancement, deep learning, and computer vision, spotting and eliminating disease-infected crops are being explored. This project deals with disease detection and classification in the Cassava plant leaves to identify the possibly infected pile and deem them unfit for human consumption. A cost-effective and scalable technology for disease detection is provided by image recognition. The TensorFlow library is used for computations on the dataset's images. For image preprocessing, we use the Keras API to load the images, convert the images into an array, and Image Data Generator for data augmentation and transformation of the data, thus facilitating better generalization of the model.
